## 📌 How to Choose the Right Security Framework
Selecting the right framework depends on your **industry, regulatory requirements, and business goals**. Here’s a quick guide:

- **If you're a SaaS company →** **SOC 2** is crucial for proving security & privacy to customers.  
- **If you're a global enterprise →** **ISO 27001** ensures a structured approach to information security.  
- **If you work with U.S. government agencies →** **FedRAMP** compliance is mandatory for cloud services.  
- **If you handle credit card payments →** **PCI-DSS** is required for payment security.  
- **If you're in healthcare →** **HIPAA** compliance protects patient data.  
- **If you're looking for general cybersecurity best practices →** **NIST CSF** and **CIS Controls** are great starting points.

## 📌 Steps to Implement a Security Framework

### 1️⃣ Conduct a Gap Assessment  
   - Compare current security controls against the framework’s requirements.  
   - Identify gaps and prioritize remediation efforts.  

### 2️⃣ Develop & Document Security Policies  
   - Draft policies that align with the framework (e.g., Access Control, Incident Response).  
   - Ensure policies are reviewed and approved by leadership.  

### 3️⃣ Implement Security Controls  
   - Deploy technical and administrative controls (e.g., encryption, logging, multi-factor authentication).  
   - Train employees on security awareness.  

### 4️⃣ Monitor & Audit Compliance  
   - Set up continuous monitoring for compliance (e.g., using tools like Drata or Vanta).  
   - Conduct regular audits and risk assessments.  

### 5️⃣ Maintain & Improve  
   - Review policies annually and update as needed.  
   - Conduct security awareness training and tabletop exercises.
